This archive contains all the input files needed to reproduce the results of the paper.


In the 'classical_unbiased_MD' folder the following files are available:
- All the initial conformations.
- A folder name 'template' containing all the GROMACS inputs for classical energy minimization, MD equilibration and production runs.
- A folder named 'unbiasedCVs' containing PLUMED input and coordinate alignment file. This are required to produce Figure 4b.


In the 'QM-MM_MD' folder the following files are available:
- Discovery simulations separately with two different graph CVs:
  * 8 atoms within the adjacency matrix (8atomsCV) and 34 atoms within the adjacency matrix (34atomsCV)
- Each of these two folders have subfolders containing inputs for running discovery simulations from each intial conforamtions.
  * MD_nvt_prod_frameID_amber.xyz is the initial conformation (IC).
  * amylase_ee.prmtop, forceeval_qmmm.cp2k-frameID.inc and react_nvt-ee_gpw_opes_new.inp are CP2K input files.
  * plumed.dat is the PLUMED input, num_cv.pt file contains the spectral graph CV.
  * label.dat mentions all the atoms included within the adjacency matrix.
  * make_plumed_qm_mm.py is a python script to produce the plumed.dat file.


The 'Wannier_centers' folder contains input files for the calculation of Wannier centers.


In the 'classical_biased_MD' folder the following files are available:
- glycam_06h.itp, amylase_GMX.top, index.ndx, nvt_prod.mdp are the GROMACS input.
- Folders 0, 1, 2, 3 contain starting coordinate file for the corresponding replica.
- plumed.dat is the PLUMED input, npt_eqm3_align2z_CA.pdb is a coordinate alignment file and the *.pt files contain the Deep-TDA neural network model Contact and Water CVs.
- init_path.pdb and final_path.pdb are the initial guess path and final path, respectively, for the path CV.
